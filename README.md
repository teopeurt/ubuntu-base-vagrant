===================

ubuntu 13.04 base box

## vagrant notes

do not install via "gem install" - stuck at 1.06
use binary instead
 and then do this -

ln -s /Applications/Vagrant/bin/vagrant /usr/local/bin/vagrant

assuming you have control over your local binary
Gets rid of that dreaded error - method not found
